This project mirrors the Java concurrency annotations source code as
described in Brian Goetz's Java Concurrency In Practice. The original
can be downloaded from:

http://www.javaconcurrencyinpractice.com/jcip-annotations-src.jar

The four annotations provided are:
	@Immutable
	@ThreadSafe
	@NotThreadSafe
	@GuardedBy

This github repository (https://github.com/chrisoei/jcip) has several branches:
 	master: contains only the source files for the annotations
	eclipse: everything in master, plus some eclipse-specific files 
		and fixes
	examples: everything in master, plus sample code from
		http://www.javaconcurrencyinpractice.com/jcip-examples-src.jar
